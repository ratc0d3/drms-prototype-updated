# 🔍 Status Dropdown Debug Instructions

## Current Issue
The status column appears as static badges instead of dropdowns.

## What Was Implemented

1. ✅ `renderStatusDropdown()` function - Returns HTML `<select>` element when user is recipient
2. ✅ `isCurrentUserRecipient()` function - Checks if current user can edit status
3. ✅ `handleStatusChange()` function - Updates status and saves to localStorage
4. ✅ localStorage persistence - Documents persist across refreshes
5. ✅ Integration in Incoming/Outgoing/Logbook views

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
**IMPORTANT:** Your browser might be caching the old JavaScript file.

1. Open the prototype: `depdev_dms_prototype.html`
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Ctrl + F5` to hard refresh
3. Or press `F12` → Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Click the "Console" tab
3. You should see debug messages like:
   ```
   Loaded X documents from localStorage
   Checking recipient for doc: 2026-05-005 to: RD currentUser: Sir Harry role: admin
   → Match: RD/admin recipient
   renderStatusDropdown called: 2026-05-005 status: For RD Approval isEditable: true
   → Returning dropdown
   ```

### Step 3: Navigate to Incoming Documents
1. Click "Incoming Documents" in the sidebar
2. Check the console for logs starting with "Checking recipient for doc:"
3. Look for messages that say "→ Match: RD/admin recipient"

### Step 4: Identify Documents with Dropdowns
As **Sir Harry (admin)**, these documents should have DROPDOWNS:
- Any document with `to: "RD"`
- Any document with `to: "Regional Director"`
- Documents: 2026-05-005, 2026-04-155, 2026-04-148, etc.

Documents with STATIC BADGES (not editable by Sir Harry):
- Documents addressed to "Chief Reyes"
- Documents addressed to "Staff Ana"
- Documents he sent (outgoing from him)

### Step 5: Verify Dropdown Appearance
A working dropdown looks like:
```
[In Progress ▼]  ← You can click this
```

NOT like:
```
[In Progress]  ← Static badge, can't click
```

### Step 6: Test the Dropdown
1. Find a document addressed to "RD" in Incoming Documents
2. Click on the status dropdown
3. Select "In Progress"
4. Console should show: `Status changed: 2026-05-005 → In Progress`
5. Page should refresh and show the new status
6. Press F5 to refresh browser - status should persist

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Browser Cache
**Solution:** Hard refresh with `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### Issue 2: JavaScript Not Loading
**Check:** Open DevTools Console, look for red errors

### Issue 3: Function Not Defined
**Solution:** Make sure `depdev_dms_prototype.js` file was saved properly

### Issue 4: All Statuses Are Static
**Check Console Logs:** 
- If you see "→ No match, not recipient" for all documents
- The recipient check logic might not be working
- Verify currentUser.role is "admin"

## Quick Test File
Open `test_status_dropdown.html` in your browser:
- This shows example dropdown vs static badge
- Click "Test Dropdown Logic Here" to see which docs should have dropdowns
- Click "Open Main Prototype" to launch the main app

## Expected Console Output

When Incoming Documents loads, you should see:
```
Checking recipient for doc: 2026-05-005 to: Regional Director currentUser: Sir Harry role: admin
  → Match: RD/admin recipient
renderStatusDropdown called: 2026-05-005 status: For RD Approval isEditable: true
  → Returning dropdown

Checking recipient for doc: 2026-05-001 to: All Staff currentUser: Sir Harry role: admin
  → No match, not recipient
renderStatusDropdown called: 2026-05-001 status: For ARD Clearance isEditable: false
  → Returning static pill
```

## File Locations
- Main prototype: `e:\WORKING_PROTOTYPE\frontend_prototype\depdev_dms_prototype.html`
- JavaScript: `e:\WORKING_PROTOTYPE\frontend_prototype\depdev_dms_prototype.js`
- Test file: `e:\WORKING_PROTOTYPE\frontend_prototype\test_status_dropdown.html`
- This file: `e:\WORKING_PROTOTYPE\frontend_prototype\DEBUG_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Next Steps If Still Not Working

1. Take a screenshot of the browser console
2. Take a screenshot of the Incoming Documents page
3. Check if you see ANY console.log messages at all
4. Verify the .js file was actually saved (check file modified timestamp)
5. Try opening in a different browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

## Remove Debug Logs Later

Once it's working, you can remove the console.log statements from:
- `isCurrentUserRecipient()` function (line ~2842)
- `renderStatusDropdown()` function (line ~2810)
