# ✅ NOTIFICATION SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Summary of Changes

The notification system was **already implemented** in the prototype but needed initialization and minor enhancements. I've made the following updates:

---

## Changes Made to `depdev_dms_prototype.js`

### 1. **Initialize Notifications on Page Load** (Line ~1760)

**ADDED:**
```javascript
// Initialize on page load
var DOCS = DOCS_DEFAULT;
initializeDocuments();

// Initialize notifications and read states
loadNotifications();
loadDocReadStates();
```

**Purpose:** Loads notifications and document read states from localStorage when the page first loads.

---

### 2. **Update Notification Badge in renderNav()** (Line ~2693)

**ADDED:**
```javascript
// Update notification badge
updateNotificationBadge(getUnreadNotificationCount());
```

**Purpose:** Ensures the notification badge shows the correct unread count whenever navigation is rendered.

---

### 3. **Enhanced openNotificationDocument() Function** (Line ~785)

**CHANGED:**
```javascript
function openNotificationDocument(docRef, notificationId) {
  if (notificationId) {
    var notif = NOTIFICATIONS.find(function (n) {
      return n.id === notificationId;
    });
    if (notif && !notif.read) {
      notif.read = true;
      saveNotifications();
    }
  }
  renderNotificationPanel();
  closeNotif();
  
  // Navigate to incoming documents first
  showPage('incoming');
  
  // Then open the specific document
  setTimeout(function() {
    viewDoc(docRef);
  }, 300);
}
```

**Purpose:** Explicitly navigates to Incoming Documents page before opening the document, ensuring the user sees the context.

---

### 4. **Duplicate Prevention in addNotification()** (Line ~818)

**ADDED:**
```javascript
// Check for duplicate notification (same recipient, type, and document within last 5 minutes)
var fiveMinutesAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 5 * 60 * 1000).toISOString();
var isDuplicate = NOTIFICATIONS.some(function(n) {
  return n.recipientKey === notification.recipientKey &&
         n.type === notification.type &&
         n.documentId === notification.documentId &&
         n.dateTime > fiveMinutesAgo;
});

if (isDuplicate) {
  console.log('Duplicate notification prevented for', notification.documentId);
  return;
}
```

**Also added:**
```javascript
updateNotificationBadge(getUnreadNotificationCount());
```

**Purpose:** Prevents duplicate notifications for the same document within 5 minutes and immediately updates the badge counter.

---

### 5. **Save Documents After Sending** (Line ~7590)

**ADDED:**
```javascript
// Save document changes to localStorage
saveDocuments();
```

**Purpose:** Persists document routing changes (to, from, status, tracking) to localStorage after sending.

---

## How the Notification System Works

### 1. **When a Document is Sent**

When a user calls **Send Document** via `submitQuickSend()`:

1. Document is routed to recipient (`d.to = recipient`)
2. Document tracking trail is updated
3. `addNotification()` is called with:
   - `recipientKey` - identifies who receives the notification
   - `type` - "document_received"
   - `documentId` - the document reference
   - `documentTitle` - document subject
   - `senderName` - who sent it
4. Notification is saved to localStorage
5. Badge counter is updated

---

### 2. **Notification Badge Display**

- **Badge shows count** of unread notifications for current user
- Updates automatically when:
  - User logs in
  - Navigation is rendered
  - Notification is marked as read
  - New notification is added
- **Badge hidden** when count is 0
- **Badge shows "9+"** when count exceeds 9

---

### 3. **Viewing Notifications**

1. User clicks **🔔 Notifications** in top bar
2. Notification panel opens showing:
   - Unread notifications (with blue dot)
   - Read notifications (no dot)
   - Sender name
   - Document title
   - Relative time ("Just now", "2 minutes ago")
3. Notifications are sorted newest first

---

### 4. **Clicking a Notification**

1. User clicks a notification
2. Notification is marked as **read**
3. Badge count decreases
4. System navigates to **Incoming Documents**
5. Document preview opens automatically
6. User can now view/process the document

---

### 5. **Mark All as Read**

- Click "Mark all read" in notification panel
- All notifications for current user become read
- Badge disappears
- Notifications remain in history

---

## User-Specific Notifications

Notifications are **completely isolated by user**:

- Each user has their own `recipientKey` based on email/role
- Notifications are filtered by current user when displaying
- Badge only shows current user's unread count
- Switching users shows different notifications

**Example:**
- User A sends doc → User B
- User B sees: 🔔 1
- User A sees: 🔔 0 (no notification badge)
- User C sees: 🔔 0 (not involved)

---

## Duplicate Prevention

Notifications **won't be created** if:
- Same recipient
- Same document
- Same notification type
- Within last 5 minutes

This prevents duplicates from:
- Page refreshes
- Navigation changes
- Re-rendering components

---

## Persistence

All notifications persist in **localStorage**:

```javascript
localStorage.getItem("depdev7_notifications")
```

**Survives:**
- Page refresh
- Browser close/reopen
- Navigation between pages
- User switching

---

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test 1: Send Document
1. Log in as User A (e.g., Sir Harry)
2. Go to Documents → Select a document
3. Click Send Document
4. Select recipient: User B (e.g., Chief Reyes)
5. Click Send

**Expected:**
- Success message appears
- Document routed to User B

---

### ✅ Test 2: Notification Badge
1. Switch to User B
2. Look at top navigation bar

**Expected:**
- 🔔 1 badge appears
- Badge shows number of unread notifications

---

### ✅ Test 3: Open Notifications
1. Click 🔔 Notifications button

**Expected:**
- Notification panel opens
- Shows: "New Document" with document title

  type: "document_received",
  documentId: "2026-05-001",
  documentRef: "2026-05-001",
  documentTitle: "Budget Request",
  senderId: "harry@depdev7.gov.ph",
  senderName: "Sir Harry",
  senderRole: "Administrator",
  message: "Sir Harry sent you a document.",
  preview: "Budget Request",
  read: false,
  dateTime: "2026-08-13T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
