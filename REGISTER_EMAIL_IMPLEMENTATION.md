  ref: "2026-08-009",
  documentId: "2026-08-009",
  type: "Email Communication",
  category: "Administrative",
  subject: "Request for Budget Documents",
  status: "New",
  date: "2026-08-18",
  kind: "incoming",
  division: "ORD",
  version: 1,
  isEmail: true,  // Flag to identify email documents
  emailContent: {
    from: "john@example.com",
    to: "office@example.com",
    cc: "admin@example.com",
    subject: "Request for Budget Documents",
    body: "Good day,\n\nWe would like to...",
